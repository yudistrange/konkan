Learn you some konkani for good

The project is a glorified dictionary.

## Development Setup
```
make dev-setup
```
This should bring up local dependencies required by the application. The configurations are present in the `resources/config.edn` file.

## Running tests
```
profile=test lein test
```
Please note that `profile` environment var needs to be set for the tests to run against the test database. By default `profile` is set to dev, thus `lein test` in isolation will run the tests against the development database

## Development Setup for the frontend
The project uses shadow-cljs for building/releasing the frontend application. The repl can be started as:
```
shadow-cljs cljs-repl konkan-ui
```
